Tuple-like Structs
==================

For conciseness, you can create structs that are used like a tuple.

--------------------------------

Unit-like Structs
=================

Structs do not have to have any fields at all.

As mentioned in Chapter 1 a *unit* is another word for an empty tuple `()`. This is why this kind of struct is called *Unit-like*.

This type of struct is rarely used.
