# Taskers
### The Tacky Task Manager For Tiresome Tasks

This is just a project built while learning the ropes in rust.
Please, if you notice something that can be improved make an issue :)

###### Download and try it! It's just a `cargo run` command away!

#### What does it do?
Outputs the contents of a task.list file to a terminal.
You can create, remove and mark tasks as complete.
